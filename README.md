# 🏞️ 🌃 Holidaze 🌅 🌉
Holidaze is a school project, where we are given an API to use to create a FrontEnd project which will work something like AirBnB or Hotels.com.
The site will only be a dummy site, and nothing is real. But it is a good way to see what we have learned in our two years at Noroff.

This project is due to be finished by May 26th.
